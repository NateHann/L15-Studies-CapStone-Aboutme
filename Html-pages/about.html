              <p>
                Hello, I'm Nathan Hannaford, an Account Manager with over 5
                years of expertise in the office automation industry. Although
                proficient and successful in my current field, which includes
                managed IT, telephony, office automation, networking, and
                business connectivity, my ambition is to transition from the
                hardware-focused aspect to the software realm. Currently delving
                into Full Stack Web Development and Application Engineering, I'm
                passionate about mastering both front and back-end web
                development, as well as software engineering. Join me on this
                exciting journey as I navigate the dynamic intersection of
                technology and innovation!
              </p>

              <h3>Hobbies & Interests</h3>
              <p>
                I find joy in gaming, mostly on PCs with titles like Valorant,
                CS, Dota, Apex, Rocket League, to name a few, and am very
                passionate about musicâ€”I produce a bit in my spare time. The
                tech world, from hardware to software, truly is my passion.
                Rainy days are my perfect time for enjoying my hobbies. While I
                love traveling, my adventures haven't been as frequent as I'd
                like, but the idea of exploring new cultures and places excites
                me. I have many other interests like sports, motorcycles, and
                socializing with friends, but the above is really what fuels my
                passion to reach my goals and dreams.
