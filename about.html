                        <p>Hello, I'm Nathan Hannaford, an Account Manager with over 5 years of expertise in the office automation industry.
                            Although proficient and successful in my current field, which includes managed IT, telephony, office automation, networking, and business connectivity, my ambition is to transition from the hardware-focused aspect to the software realm.
                            Currently delving into Full Stack Web Development and Application Engineering, I'm passionate about mastering both front and back-end web development, as well as software engineering.
                            Join me on this exciting journey as I navigate the dynamic intersection of technology and innovation!</p>

                        <h3>Hobbies & Interests</h3>
                        <!-- Hobbies and interests text -->
                        <p>I find joy in gaming, mostly on PCs with titles like Valorant, CS, Dota, Apex, Rocket League, to name a few, 
                            and am very passionate about musicâ€”I produce a bit in my spare time.
                            The tech world, from hardware to software, truly is my passion.
                            Rainy days are my perfect time for enjoying my hobbies. While I love traveling, my adventures haven't been as frequent as I'd like, but the idea of exploring new cultures and places excites me.
                            I have many other interests like sports, motorcycles, and socializing with friends, but the above is really what fuels my passion to reach my goals and dreams.
                        </p>
