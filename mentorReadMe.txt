Hi there, HD Mentor!

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to share some feedback on my project.

In my previous CapStone project, I noticed that it didn't align perfectly with the expected task requirements.It was more of as about me page than a restaurant page ,this caused difficulty in implemeneting task requirements in a way that makes sense.To my defense the page did cover details like my hobbies and interests as initially suggested in that task. However, it became quite challenging to integrate the JS Fundamentals CapStone task requirements into my existing older CapStone project in a meaningful way.

To tackle this, I decided to create two additional HTML pages within a content section. These pages served as a platform for adding blogs and a gallery. This approach allowed me to incorporate the task requirements in a more meaningful way, demonstrating my understanding of them. It wasn't so much an issue of not being willing to redo my previous CapStone project,because I am willing to do so;I was unsure so I went about about finding the right place to implement these requirements in a way that actually makes sense.
.
Just to recap, here's how I addressed the task requirements:

Implemented a "Save for Later" feature with a corresponding button - Done.
Added alerts to notify users when items were added and display the count of items in the "Saved for Later" section - Done.
Created a comment form and included a function to delete comments - Done.
Introduced a "Like" button for various segments of the project - Done.
Implemented a "Hide and Show" feature - Done (on the Blog page).
Designed a dropdown menu - Done.
Included animation effects - Done.
Implemented a chained function - Done.
I kindly request some leniency in the evaluation of my CapStone project, as I'm more than willing to redo it in a different HTML page that would suit task requirements better, if that's your preference.I encountered a challenge and tried to be as creative as possible in finding a solution,my only answer was adding a content section where these task requirements made sense.
Thank you for your understanding.

Kind Regards,
Nate
